//! Operation-specific protocol-v2 mutation plans.
//!
//! Plan construction validates input, allocates every new value, and reserves
//! the exact in-memory capacities before SQLite commits. The post-commit step
//! is an infallible closure over only the touched state. Plans must never clone
//! or project the full mux tree, with one exception: an operation that must
//! conserve tabs (see `mux::layout_invariants`) runs its state step before the
//! commit, under the same locks, keeping a clone of the previous state so the
//! layout checker can reject it and a failed commit can restore it. Plans that
//! already project a clone hand it over with [`ResourceMutationPlan::replacing`],
//! so staging them costs no second clone.
